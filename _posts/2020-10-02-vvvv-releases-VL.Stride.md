Helo Striders,

We've just released a new 3d-engine for [vvvv](http://visualprogramming.net), our visual live-programming environment for .NET. We call it "VL.Stride" and it is basically a wrapper around the Stride engine, using it independent from the Stride Game Studio. 

In this [release blog post](https://vvvv.org/blog/vl.stride-for-evvvveryone), we talk about some details.

Note that vvvv's focus is not on creating games. Due to its live-programming nature, using a state hot-reload approach, it may still be interesting for you to quickly prototype some functionality for your games.

We'd like to invite you to play with it and hear your feedback. vvvv is free for non-commercial use, no strings attached. So please just go ahead, [download vvvv gamma 2020.3-preview](http://visualprogramming.net/) and let us know what you think!

## NODE20
If you're already convinced and want to learn more about vvvv, join us for [30 online workshops](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/workshops/) covering various topics, we're running during the [NODE20 - Forum for Digital Arts](https://20.nodeforum.org/) from October 3rd to 8th.

To give you an idea, the following workshops will be using VL.Stride:

- [Introduction to vvvv, VideoFX & Compositing](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=Jb1dpKqvOVzARBsfv8h)
- [Realtime graphics with Stride 3D â€“ The Fundamentals](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=fdmYwsGOetD3L7Vs7Iph)
- [Patching Materials](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=fzhQkCecOIp6kU6WsLiO)
- [Beyond Sound and Visual](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=nO7aO8hdYv14R1PiBPBp)
- [VL.Stride Deepdive](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=NNA9Lhd4ICiw6VIzlFAr)
- [A preview to ShaderFX](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=N02FO8JjRyk1TbJyw819)
- [Working with the Stride GameStudio](https://20.nodeforum.org/program/?lectureId=RVC2tTBN3u4EXgGc8x5W)

As you can see, with vvvv we're quite invested in Stride. We bow before everyone who helped to make it what it is today and want to do our best to contribute our share to give it a bright future. 

Yours, 
vvvv.
